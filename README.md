# Brute Framework

The Brute Hacking framework is my version of PentestBox with updated tools and services but also with a few more updates of tools and updated interface.



## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility improvements.
I have also made sure that i install a proper installer and listing script to install new projects into the framework
but it will also has a update-installer script to update the installer.
The installer.sh script is located on https://github.com/morpheuslord/installer_update_brute it is an updateable project just add it into its appropriate location and then configure the installer location after that save it and just use the update function on your brute-framework to update it.



The other optimization is that in the previous version everything was scattered and had a lot of useless tools so i organized it and removed some of the useless tools making it better for fast and reliable usage.

I also included metasploit into the framework and this requires you to add exception in your anitivirus software to run smoothly.
## Features

## Further updates

The current update I am working on is the package installer or the `update-installer.sh` filei am trying to make it more like a package installer.

Currently it uses the updated file from another repo of mine to update but i want to eliminate that need.

By the way if you know any cool tool that is compatible with windows add that in the installer file it will rise the tools the users like yourself and others can use making it even better.
